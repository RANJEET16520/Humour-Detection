# Humour-Detection
Humour detection has an important role in applications like a chatbot, human-machine interaction. But automation of this task is complex due to the semantic structure of the text. In this project, I used the yelp customer review dataset wherein each review has a weighted tag 'funny'. The dataset being crowd annotated is of high quality for the task of humour detection. I describe the experiments on the dataset and the mechanism of the classification into humourous and non-humorous categories. Each review is tokenized followed by generating word vectors using word2vec. The resulting word vectors are used as input to the Convolutional Neural Network and Long Short-Term Memory. The LSTM had a high performance at the expense of training time. LSTM outperformed CNN in all metrics used i.e. precision, recall, accuracy, F1 score, and area under the ROC curve.
